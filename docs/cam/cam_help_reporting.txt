Reports:

  The "--report" PATTERN parameter can refer to any number of nodes in the device tree. For each node referenced, a new Report will be created and appended to the file specified by DEST for that report. If these reports should be written to different files, variables can be used in the destination filename to differentiate:
    %l => Location in device tree of report instantiation
    %i => Index of report instantiation
    %p => Host process ID
    %t => Timestamp
    %s => Simulator name

  Additionaly, the DEST parameter can be a filename or "1", referring to stdout, or "2", referring to stderr
  If outputting to stdout/stderr. the optional report FORMAT parameter should be omitted or "txt" .

  Valid formats include:
  txt, text -> Plaintext report output
  html, htm -> Basic HTML Report Output
  csv, csv_cumulative -> CSV Report Output (supports updating)
  js_json, jsjson -> JavaScript Object Notation Report Output
  python, py -> Python dictionary output
  json, JSON -> JavaScript Object Notation Report Output
  json_reduced, JSON_reduced -> JavaScript Object Notation Report Output with only stat values reported
  json_detail, JSON_detail -> JavaScript Object Notation Report Output with only non-stat value information reported (desc, vis, etc...)
  gnuplot, gplt -> Gnuplot report output
  stats_mapping -> Mapping from CSV column headers to Statistic Instance locations
