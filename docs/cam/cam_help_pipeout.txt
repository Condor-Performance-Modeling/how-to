Pipeline-Collection Options:
  -z [ --pipeline-collection ] OUTPUTPATH   Run pipeline collection on this simulation, and dump the output files to OUTPUTPATH. OUTPUTPATH
                                            can be a prefix such as myfiles_ for the pipeline files and may be a directory
                                            Example: "--pipeline-collection data/test1_"
                                            Note: Any directories in this path must already exist.
                                            
  -k [ --collection-at ] TREENODE           Specify a treenode to recursively turn on at and below for pipeline collection.Example: 
                                            "--collection-at top.core0.rename" This option can be specified none or many times.
  -K [ --pipeViewer-collection-at ] ALFFILE Specify an pipeViewer ALFFILE file to restrict pipeline collection to only those nodes found in
                                            the ALF.Example: "--pipeViewer-collection-at layouts/exe40.alf" This option can be specified 
                                            none or many times.
  --heartbeat HEARTBEAT                     The interval in ticks at which index pointers will be written to file during pipeline 
                                            collection. The heartbeat also represents the longest life duration of lingering transactions. 
                                            Transactions with a life span longer than the heartbeat will be finalized and then restarted 
                                            with a new start time. Must be a multiple of 100 for efficient reading by pipeViewer. Large 
                                            values will reduce responsiveness of pipeViewer when jumping to different areas of the file and
                                            loading.
                                            Default = 0 ticks.
